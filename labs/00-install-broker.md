# Installing the AMQ 7 Broker

To begin, verify you have [all of the prerequisites](README.md) for these labs. 

As a reminder, JBoss AMQ 7 comes with four main components:

* AMQ 7 Broker
* AMQ 7 Interconnect Router
* AMQ 7 Clients
* Management Console

The Broker comes with the management console, but the Interconnect Router and each individual client comes as a separate binary/download/installation. 

We'll start by downloading the binaries for JBoss AMQ 7 Broker. In later labs, we'll get to the [clients](20-clients.md) as well as the [interconnect router](80-install-qdr.md)

All of the components are available at the [Downloads page](https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/) of [https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/overview/](https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/overview/). Navigate to that page and download the AMQ 7 Broker:

![Download AMQ 7 Broker](images/install/downloadbroker.png)

Alternatively, if you are a current Red Hat customer, you can download the latest AMQ 7 (and any associated patches) from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-jboss-amq/). Even if you don't currently have JBoss AMQ subscriptions, you still have access to all of the Red Hat products and documentation for development/evaluation purposes. 

Once you click one of the download links and you have the broker downloaded, navigate to your command line (Powershell, Bash, Cygwin, etc) and locate the newly downloaded file (e.g. `jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1-bin.zip`). You can move this .zip file to a location of your choosing (e.g. ~/dev/labs or similar). 

Using your favorite `unzip` utility, unzip the `jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1-bin.zip` binary file and navigate into the newly created directory:
 
    $ unzip jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1-bin.zip
    $ cd jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1
    
If you do a listing of the directory, you should see something similar to this:

    $ ls -l 
    
```

```    

Let's have a look at each folder:

* `bin` -- Set up scripts for creating and managing brokers
* `etc` -- Bootstrap settings for running `artemis` commands
* `examples` -- handful of useful examples for getting started with AMQ 7
* `lib` -- where the AMQ 7 libs and dependencies are packaged
* `schema` -- config files schemas
* `web` -- where the main web console configuration and libraries are stored

## Creating a Broker

Up until this point, we've just download the main binaries and bootstrap configuration, but we still don't have a broker. 

> Note this is a bit different from AMQ6 if you've used that in the past. In AMQ6, the initial binary download was the broker itself. With AMQ 7, we need to explicitly create a broker with the settings that we prefer.

Let's create a new folder in a location we choose (could be inside the installation folder if we'd like) called `brokers` and let's create a new broker inside of it:

    $ mkdir brokers
    $ ./bin/artemis create brokers/myfirstbroker
    
You'll be prompted to enter information that we've left off the command line. Fill in the user, password, and other information similar to this:
    
```
Creating ActiveMQ Artemis instance at: /Users/ceposta/dev/activemq/jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1/brokers/myfirstbroker

--user: is a mandatory property!
Please provide the default username:
admin

--password: is mandatory with this configuration:
Please provide the default password:


--allow-anonymous | --require-login: is a mandatory property!
Allow anonymous access?, valid values are Y,N,True,False
Y

Auto tuning journal ...
done! Your system can make 14.71 writes per millisecond, your journal-buffer-timeout will be 68000

You can now start the broker by executing:  

   "/Users/ceposta/dev/activemq/jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1/brokers/myfirstbroker/bin/artemis" run

Or you can run the broker in the background using:

   "/Users/ceposta/dev/activemq/jboss-amq-7.0.0.redhat-1/brokers/myfirstbroker/bin/artemis-service" start
```    

Congrats! You've just created your *first* AMQ 7 broker :)

Note that some auto-tuning was done based on your environment. This is pretty handy when it comes to selecting the appropriate configuration for your persistent messaging use cases, but we'll come back to that in a subsequent lab.  

If you're curious what command-line arguments you *can* pass to the `create` command, use the `help` command like this:

    $ ./bin/artemis help <command>
    
So in this case, we'd list the help documentation for the `create` command like this:

    $ ./bin/artemis help create
    
## Starting our new broker
    
In the previous section, we created a new broker and in the output of the command we saw instructions for how to start the broker.
Before we do that, let's navigate to our new `brokers/myfirstbroker` folder and check out the directory structure and see what was created. 
      
    $ cd brokers/myfirstbroker
    $ ls -l 
    
```
drwxr-xr-x  4 ceposta  staff   136B May 10 13:58 bin
drwxr-xr-x  2 ceposta  staff    68B May 10 13:58 data
drwxr-xr-x  9 ceposta  staff   306B May 10 13:58 etc
drwxr-xr-x  2 ceposta  staff    68B May 10 13:58 log
drwxr-xr-x  2 ceposta  staff    68B May 10 13:58 tmp
```
    
These are the folders in the newly created broker `myfirstbroker`. Let's see what they have in them:
    
* `bin` -- scripts to control the lifecycle of our new broker
* `data` -- where all of the transaction/journal logs are stored for our messages
* `etc` -- the configuration for our broker
* `log` -- the log output from running our broker
* `tmp` -- temporary disk usage

We'll start the new broker in the foreground with the following:

    $ ./bin/artemis run
    
```

```    

Yay! We've got our broker installed and running!

Take a quick glance at the log output and note a few things:

* The location of our transaction logs and cluster configuration
* We're using the NIO Journal for persistence
* We have a single port, `61616` that can accept connections for multiple protocols (i.e. `CORE`, `MQTT`, `AMQP`, `STOMP`, `HORNETQ`, `OPENWIRE`)
* We have individual ports for each protocol as well
* We see that the web console has been started at `http://localhost:8161`
* We see that the Jolokia (a JMX over REST) service has been started at `http://localhost:8161/jolokia`

That's it for this lab!
