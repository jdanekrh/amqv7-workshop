# AMQ 7 Clients

AMQ 7 comes with several new clients covering a variety of protocols and programming languages. In the past, any supported clients were only released when we released new versions of the AMQ product. With AMQ 7 that has changed; each client has its own lifecycle and is released independently from the AMQ broker/server components. 

AMQ 7 includes the following supported clients:

* AMQ JMS Client ([official docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_jms_client/))
* AMQ C++ Client ([official docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_cpp_client/))
* AMQ JavaScript/NodeJS Client ([official docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_javascript_client/))
* AMQ Python Client ([official docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_python_client/))
* AMQ .NET Client ([official docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_.net_client/))

Let's explore the clients.

## AMQ JMS Client

To use the AMQ JMS client, navigate to [https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/](https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/) and locate the AMQ JMS Client.

![Download JMS](images/client/download-jms-client.png)

When you've downloaded the file, copy it to a location where you'd like to unzip this client.

    $ mv ~/Downloads/apache-qpid-jms-0.21.0.redhat-1-bin.zip ./clients/
    $ cd clients
    $ unzip apache-qpid-jms-0.21.0.redhat-1-bin.zip
    $ cd apache-qpid-jms-0.21.0.redhat-1
    
    
Now we'll explore the client. In the distribution we just unzipped, there's an `examples` folder. Navigate into it and you'll find a Java Maven project. Let's build the project:


    $ cd examples
    $ mvn install
    
If successful, you should see output like this:
    
```
[INFO] 
[INFO] --- maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ qpid-jms-examples ---

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```    

Feel free to open this project in your favorite IDE (like [JBoss Developer Studio](https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/overview/)). 

A couple of things to notice about this example:

* Our JMS ConnectionFactory and destination names are configured in the `src/main/resources/jndi.properties` file
* Our `org.apache.qpid.jms.example.HelloWorld` main() class bootstraps the `MessageConsumer` and `MessageProducer` used in this example
* We lookup the JMS connection information from JNDI as specified in our `jndi.properties` file
* We send one message and receive one message.

Review the code closer to get an idea of what it's doing:

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try {
            // The configuration for the Qpid InitialContextFactory has been supplied in
            // a jndi.properties file in the classpath, which results in it being picked
            // up automatically by the InitialContext constructor.
            Context context = new InitialContext();

            ConnectionFactory factory = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup("myFactoryLookup");
            Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup("myQueueLookup");

            Connection connection = factory.createConnection(System.getProperty("USER"), System.getProperty("PASSWORD"));
            connection.setExceptionListener(new MyExceptionListener());
            connection.start();

            Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);

            MessageProducer messageProducer = session.createProducer(queue);
            MessageConsumer messageConsumer = session.createConsumer(queue);

            TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("Hello world!");
            messageProducer.send(message, DeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT, Message.DEFAULT_PRIORITY, Message.DEFAULT_TIME_TO_LIVE);
            TextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage) messageConsumer.receive(2000L);

            if (receivedMessage != null) {
                System.out.println(receivedMessage.getText());
            } else {
                System.out.println("No message received within the given timeout!");
            }

            connection.close();
        } catch (Exception exp) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception, exiting.");
            exp.printStackTrace(System.out);
            System.exit(1);
        }
    }
```

To run this example, we'll first download all of the project's dependencies:

    $ mvn clean package dependency:copy-dependencies -DincludeScope=runtime -DskipTests
    
Next, we need to make sure our broker is running. If you've followed from the previous labs, you have a broker running with a single `Acceptor` running on port `61616`. Let's change our `jndi.properties` file to reflect this change. (if you're coming to this lab from your own installation/running instance of the AMQ 7 broker, adjust the properties as needed; e.g., if you still have the dedicated AMQP `Acceptor` running, then no need to make this change). 

Our `jndi.properties` file should look like this, with the `connectionfactory.myFactoryLookup` property set to `61616`

NOTE: We need to change the connection factory URL to `61616` since our `acceptor` does not have the other ports open.

```
# Set the InitialContextFactory class to use
java.naming.factory.initial = org.apache.qpid.jms.jndi.JmsInitialContextFactory

# Define the required ConnectionFactory instances
# connectionfactory.<JNDI-lookup-name> = <URI>
connectionfactory.myFactoryLookup = amqp://localhost:61616

# Configure the necessary Queue and Topic objects
# queue.<JNDI-lookup-name> = <queue-name>
# topic.<JNDI-lookup-name> = <topic-name>
queue.myQueueLookup = queue
topic.myTopicLookup = topic
```
    
Now let's build our project and run:

    $ mvn clean install
    $ java -cp "target/classes/:target/dependency/*" org.apache.qpid.jms.example.HelloWorld
    
If everything completed properly, you should see the following output:

```
Hello world!
```

#### Some things to note:

The URL we passed to the connection factory should be in the following form:

> amqp[s]://hostname:port[?option=value[&option2=value...]]

We can also use the failover URI (discussed in future lab) like this:

> failover:(amqp://host1:port[,amqp://host2:port...])[?option=value[&option2=value...]]

Options for configuration can be [found at the AMQ 7 JMS Client product documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_amq/7.0/html/using_the_amq_jms_client/configuration#connection_uri_options_jms)


## AMQ NodeJS Client

The AMQ NodeJS client can be used to connect to the AMQ 7 broker (or any compatible AMQP 1.0 broker) and can send and receive messages regardless of what clients produced them (ie, they could be MQTT IoT producers for example). 

To use the AMQ NodeJS client, navigate to [https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/](https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/) and locate the AMQ NodeJS (called "JavaScript" in the download portal) Client.

![Download JMS](images/client/download-node-client.png)

When you've downloaded the file, copy it to a location where you'd like to unzip this client.

    $ mv ~/Downloads/nodejs-rhea-0.2.0-1.zip . ./clients/
    $ cd clients
    $ unzip nodejs-rhea-0.2.0-1.zip
    $ cd nodejs-rhea-0.2.0-1
    
To run the examples, we'll need to install two dependencies:

    $ npm install debug
    $ npm install yargs
    
Now let's navigate to the `examples` folder and take a look at the application that will receive messages from the broker:

    $ cd node_modules/rhea/examples
    
Open up the `simple_recv.js` file in your favorite editor:

```js
var args = require('yargs').options({
      'm': { alias: 'messages', default: 100, describe: 'number of messages to expect'},
      'n': { alias: 'node', default: 'examples', describe: 'name of node (e.g. queue) from which messages are received'},
      'p': { alias: 'port', default: 5672, describe: 'port to connect to'}
    }).help('help').argv;

var received = 0;
var expected = args.messages;

container.on('message', function (context) {
    if (context.message.id && context.message.id < received) {
        // ignore duplicate message
        return;
    }
    if (expected === 0 || received < expected) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(context.message.body))
        if (++received === expected) {
            context.receiver.detach();
            context.connection.close();
        }
    }
});

container.connect({'port':args.port}).open_receiver(args.node);
```


We see that this simple receiver application tries to connect to a broker on port `5672` by default (which is also the AMQP default port) and tries to read messages from the `examples` queue. Since we have our broker running on port `61616`, let's run our receiver and direct it to connect to our broker on the correct port:

    $ node simple_recv.js -p 61616
    
Open another window to run our sender. Navigate back to the same directory where the examples where and run:

    $ node simple_send.js -p 61616
    
Note that for the sender, we're also changing its port. Hit enter to run the sender. You should see similar output:

From the receiver:

```
{"sequence":1}
. 
.
.
{"sequence":90}
{"sequence":91}
{"sequence":92}
{"sequence":93}
{"sequence":94}
{"sequence":95}
{"sequence":96}
{"sequence":97}
{"sequence":98}
{"sequence":99}
{"sequence":100}
```

From the sender:

```
sent 1
.
.
.
sent 90
sent 91
sent 92
sent 93
sent 94
sent 95
sent 96
sent 97
sent 98
sent 99
sent 100
all messages confirmed
```




## Other clients

You can download the other clients from the Red Hat support portal or the developers.redhat.com site. At the moment all the clients are available for download there EXCEPT the *Python* and *Linux C++* libraries (for RHEL). Those are available as RPMs through your RHEL subscription.
